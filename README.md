# 2D-Physics-Sim
2d physics sim built from the ground up

This simulation uses the verlet method to simulate 2D physics with balls.
this simulation takes into account:
-gravity
-drag
-mass, velocity, acceleration etc..
-friction
-elasticity
-collisions

It uses Pygame for a visual interface and allows for manipulation of:
-size
-elasticity
-friction
-density
-velocity
-color
